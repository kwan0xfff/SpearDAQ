SpearDAQ
========

Preface
--------

This code here represents the work of senior year students in
Aerospace Engineering at San Jose State University, produced in 2015.
I (Rick) was specificially advisor to the Spartan Spear team,
but provided technical advice/assistance to other teams in the
senior design class as well.
The work here is that of team members, with some minor assist from me
to overcome some performance hurdles.

Note that the external link to www.projectspartanspear.com no longer
goes to the student project.

The Project
-----------

SpearDAQ is the "Spear data acquisition system".

This is intended as a collection of data acquisition and analysis tools
supporting various phases of the `Spartan Spear`_ rocket project.

The initial collection is `Campaign1504`_ -- data acquisition and analysis
for the April 2015 test campaign.
More info in the `overview`_.
